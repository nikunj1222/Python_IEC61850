# Python_IEC61850

This python library is build from mzAutomation pyiec61850 lib **(https://github.com/mz-automation/libiec61850)**.

The idea of this lib is to create some python code for IEC61850 implemenatation.


Following files were built from mzAutomation library :

_iec61850.exp
_iec61850.lib
_iec61850.pyd
iec61850.py

The example show some basic scripting capablities which can be developed for testing and troubleshooting IEC61850 servers.

More ideas are welcome.

Currently I am developing this library as per my needs.
